### Real-World Impact

**For SpiderMonkey Source Compression:**

   - Faster decompression reduces script loading time
   - 30-44% improvement in decompression speed
   - Particularly beneficial for large frameworks

2. **Memory Efficiency**
   - 11-15% smaller compressed size saves memory
   - More efficient caching of compressed sources
   - Better utilization of source cache

3. **Build Performance**
   - 1.86-3.06x faster compression during source processing
   - Reduced time for compression-heavy operations
   - Better scalability for large codebases

4. **Network Benefits**
   - Smaller compressed sources for remote script loading
   - Better compression ratios reduce bandwidth usage
   - Especially beneficial for mobile and slow connections

## Chunking Performance

Both algorithms maintain excellent chunking performance:

- **64KB chunk size** optimal for both algorithms
- **Random access** decompression works efficiently
- **Memory overhead** is minimal for chunk offset tables
- **Cache locality** is preserved with chunked structure

## Algorithm Selection Recommendations

### Default Configuration (javascript.options.compression.algorithm = 1)
**Recommended: zstd (algorithm 1, level 0)**
- Best overall performance for most use cases
- Significant speed improvements with better compression
- Minimal complexity overhead

### High Compression Scenarios (level 6)
**Use case: Long-term storage, bandwidth-constrained environments**
- 1-2% additional compression ratio improvement
- Still faster than zlib for compression
- Same decompression speed as default zstd

### Legacy Compatibility (algorithm 0)
**Use case: Environments requiring zlib compatibility**
- Maintains existing compression format
- Reliable fallback option
- Compatible with existing compressed data

## Conclusion

The implementation of zstd compression in SpiderMonkey provides **significant performance benefits** across all metrics:

- âœ… **1.86-3.06x faster compression** (scales with size)
- âœ… **11.5-15.3% better compression ratios**
- âœ… **27.7-44.2% faster decompression**
- âœ… **Maintained chunking compatibility**
- âœ… **Automatic algorithm detection**
- âœ… **Configurable compression levels**

The dual-algorithm infrastructure enables SpiderMonkey to optimize for different use cases while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing zlib-compressed sources.
